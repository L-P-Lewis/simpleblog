# Case of the Killer Robot Case Procedings

The following is a set of notes taken on a mock trial about a malfunctioning industrial robot.

## Cindy Yardley

### Prosecution
- 1.03 Violation
    - Cindy violated by failing to approve safe software and faked software tests
- Honesty Violation
    - Falsified tests and did not tell anyone
- 1.06 Vioation
    - Was not fare and was deceptive

### Defense
- Cindy was just a student
    - Never took ethics class or knew of code
- Cindy was placed in as the sole tester
    - Corruption on part of Ray Johnson
- No actual Email receipts
    - Was lied to about practices

### Prosecution 2
- You don't need to read the code of ethics to know what she did was wrong
    - But did she know that it would be that bad?
    - Ray Johnson said that it wasn't
- 7.04 States that she failed to do what she should

### Defense 2
- Johnson claimed that the testing was only a formality and was not needed
- Poor user interface is to blame going off of what Johnson said to Cindy
- But her job is to do testing...
    - But also listen to her boss...
- DENIED in attempting to tell issues to Randy

### Prosecution 3
- Cindy should have known that the tests were important
    - She should have had no reason to falsify the tests if they were trivialized

### Defense 3
- Cindy was too inexperienced to deny her boss
    - She was told by Johnson that her output would not be considered
    - She was told that she had no stakes (BUT WHY LIE THEN???)

### Prosecution Closing
- You still have to do your job even if your boss tells you to do stuff shityly
- Being unaware of consequences does not absolve actions

### Defense Closing
- Client was cooperative with the law
- Yardley was manipulated by employers
    - They are trying to scapegoat her
- Was not able to tell that there was a large scale issue

    - Dishonest with workers
    - Knowingly allowed unsafe code

### Defense 1
- He was being pressured by upper management
    - Robotics would have ben cut if he didn't meet expectations
- He just believed that people should do their best
- He thought that issues would be minimal
- Heee thought that the user interface would be enough
- Not his fault that he trusted his team too much

### Prosecution 2
- He clearly lied to Yardley about how testing works
- He put too much trust in UI design

### Defense 2
- He respected privacy and wanted to hide trade secrets he totally wasn't hiding things
- He wanted the failsafe to be enough

### Prosecution 3

### Defense Closing
- He did everything he could with the information that he had
- His priority in decision making was keeping everyone's jobs.
