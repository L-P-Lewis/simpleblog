# Simpleblog

Simpleblog is a barebones blog hosting service written in Rust.

Simpleblog was written more-or-less over a weekend as a test project to learn the Poem crate. Currently there are no plans to actively update Simpleblog.

## Installation

Simply clone the repository and build it using Cargo.

## Usage

After building, run Simpleblog from the command line with one argument pointing to a config.yml file. 

``` bash
simpleblog 'siteconfig.yml'
```
